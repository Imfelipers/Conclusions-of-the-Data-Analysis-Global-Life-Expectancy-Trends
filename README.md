This dataset provides a comprehensive view of life expectancy trends worldwide from 1950 to 2023. It includes detailed information about countries, continents, and regions, making it a valuable resource for understanding how life expectancy has evolved over the decades.




In the analysis conducted, a graph was observed that shows the trend of the average life expectancy, ordered from highest to lowest. According to the data, San Marino, Monaco, and Andorra are at the top of the list of countries with the highest average life expectancy.

The five countries with the highest life expectancy are as follows:
	1.	San Marino
	2.	Monaco
	3.	Andorra
	4.	Guernsey
	5.	Liechtenstein

On the other hand, the five countries with the lowest life expectancy are:
	1.	Nigeria
	2.	Mali
	3.	Sierra Leone
	4.	South Sudan
	5.	USSR

The average life expectancy of the five countries with the highest life expectancy is 77.46 years, while the average life expectancy of the five countries with the lowest life expectancy is 42.21 years. This represents a significant difference of 83.47%.

Additionally, a dedicated page has been created to implement filters that allow for the querying of specific data by country and year, making it easier to access detailed and personalized information.

A key finding from the analysis is the notable increase in life expectancy over the years. This trend reflects a general improvement in the quality of life across populations, as well as a greater ability to adapt to diseases and everyday hazards. This progress has been pivotal in the sustained increase in life expectancy worldwide.
